## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this challenge I became comfortable with CSS Flexbox and Grid and this is very useful for me to use them in Real world Projects

This is some of my code, see below:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  max-width: 1150px;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 15px;
}

.grid-item {
  /* border: 4px solid red; */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 30px 40px;
  border-radius: 15px;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```




### Continued development

I will continue learning Media Queries to make my code flexible and responsive
